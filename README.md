# Solar-Data-Analysis-with-SunPy-Astroinformatics
This repository demonstrates the fundamental entry point for modern solar physics using the sunpy library. While the code is concise, it utilizes a metadata-aware framework that powers global space weather forecasting and heliophysics research.

### 1️⃣ From Pixels to Physics

- Traditional image libraries treat images as `(x, y)` pixel grids.
- SunPy interprets images in **Helioprojective solar coordinates**.
- Measurements can be made in arcseconds and converted to kilometers.
- Solar structures (flares, filaments, loops) become measurable physical objects.

### 2️⃣ World Coordinate System (WCS)

- FITS headers store satellite position and observation metadata.
- SunPy automatically parses this information.
- Enables precise solar alignment and spatial accuracy.
- Supports multi-satellite image fusion.
- Allows solar rotation correction and time-series analysis.

### 3️⃣ Big Data & AI Pipeline Entry

- Solar observatories generate terabytes of data daily.
- SunPy provides the first structured entry point into that data.
- Forms the foundation for:
  - Solar flare detection systems
  - CME tracking algorithms
  - Space weather forecasting models
  - AI/ML training pipelines

## ✂️ Coordinate-Based Region Extraction

- Regions can be cropped using physical solar coordinates.
- Supports active region tracking.
- Enables dataset generation for machine learning.
- Allows localized solar event analysis.
- Operates in physical space rather than pixel space.
